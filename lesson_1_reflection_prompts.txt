How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  I am using windows so I used FC to compare two versions of a file. Once I
applied the FC command I was able to see the difference in two versions of a
file. Unlike doing manually, Fc just listed the differences between the two
files in saving me time to go through the whole codes. It also provided me with
two versions which was easier for me to compare. Two version side by side also
gave me a snap shot of what I was looking at.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  Having entire history of the file gives the programmer to look back at the
  entire code building steps. The programmer can go through the developmental
  phase and  comb through the goods and bads of the  entire process. The
  programmer can  reutilize the good aspects of the coding process in the future
  projects. At the same time, the programmer can eliminate  the bad aspects to
  refine the codes to make more efficient. The history also provides the
  programmer necessary documents to see the progress made through time.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

                                  Pros
Gives you the flexibility to commit or not.
The programmer has the ultimate power.
The programmer can use the judgement for the whole process.


                                  Cons
The programmer needs to start the commit. if not it will not work.
One more things  added to the programmer's mandatory  to do lists.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  I think it varies with the type of files intended to be used by different
  version control systems. Git is a more advanced VCS which allows the user to
  save multiple files in one commit as these files could be comparable to each
  other. Where as Google Docs primary focus is not to compare two files but to
  make changes to the file. So they treat each file separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log command shows the list of all the commits made to the files
starting from recent to the original. It also provides the time and date when
the commit was made. So you are able to track down the changes made to the
files.
  Git diff provides the comparable information between the  two commits. You
 can use the information to find out what was added or deleted in between the
commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I'll be able to fix the issue easily as its easy to track down
    what broke down using version control.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I still have to figure it out. But most likely I'll use it for my future
    projects.
